This folder contains all assets used Except for the "Brackeys folder" as it is too large, make sure you have it imported into your scene. 
Everyting else is defaut Unity2d Project settings, logs etc. 
You need only start a new project, import "brackeys 2d mega pack" using unitys package manager and then drag, drop and overwrite the assets folder. :)
